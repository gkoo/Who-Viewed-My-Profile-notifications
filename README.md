Who Viewed My Profile? Notifications
====================================

This is a Chrome user script that will create a [Chrome Desktop Notification](http://developer.chrome.com/extensions/notifications.html) when someone has viewed your LinkedIn profile. Under the hood, it is polling LinkedIn's REST API for Who's Viewed My Profile and generating a notification when there is a new view.

This user script was created as a means to experiment with Chrome's desktop notifications and was never meant to be used as anything more than a prototype.
